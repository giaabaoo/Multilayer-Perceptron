# Multilayer-Perceptron


## Description

In this repo, a rudimentary MLP is built to do the following classification task:
- Training data (X, Y): Training data contains N1 = 100,000 points in 2-dimentional space and
are followed by the uniform radius between 0 and 5 and its label is 1 is it is inside circle of
radius 5, otherwise it is 0 (see below).
- Validation data (X, Y):
Validation data contains N2 = 20,000 points in 2-dimentional space and are followed by the
uniform radius between 0 and 5 and its label is 1 is it is inside the circle, otherwise it is 0
- Testing data (X, Y):Testing data contains N2 = 20,000 points in 2-dimentional space and are followed by the
uniform radius between 0 and 5 and its label is 1 is it is inside the circle, otherwise it is 0

## Getting Started
